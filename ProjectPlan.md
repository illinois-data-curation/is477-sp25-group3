Overview: 

This project will dive into two different aspects of what would essentially make a successful and efficient basketball team. In this project, we will use historical player data as well as identify trends, primarily associated with how effective offensive rebounds can be in winning individual games. This data will hopefully help us to best answer our research questions stated below. Additionally, perhaps offer new insights to long-term NBA fans through statistically significant data that the fans may have otherwise seldom considered. 

Research Question(s): 

Which player stats are most indicative of All-Star selection or MVP awards?

In the NBA (National Basketball Association), there are awards that players can earn for different statistical and team oriented achievements. For example, a player is likely to win an MVP award if they are the best statistical player on their team and if their team performs well for their conference throughout the regular season. Other awardsâ€™ requirements vary. For instance, there are playoff awards that are independent from regular season achievements. 

What is the correlation between offensive rebounds and probability of winning?

Offensive rebound quantity is very crucial in determining who is likely to win because it gives the team another opportunity of scoring, if they were to miss a shot. Although the shot clock only resets to 14 seconds instead of the traditional 24 seconds, it still can be significant, especially if the team can capitalize on a weakness the defense might have quickly enough.

Team:

Our team consists of two people, Faris Hammad and Jon Han. We both plan to share and split up all of the responsibilities within this project. These responsibilities include all of the work and processes that are involved in the initial project plan, status / interim report, and final project submission. For the initial project plan, we will both work on finding and identifying datasets from various online sources to work on. From these datasets, we will then work together to figure out specific research questions that we want to address. We will also write out a plan overview, team responsibilities, and a detailed timeline. For the status / interim report, we are going to work on answering our research questions with our chosen datasets. We will make sure to split up the responsibilities such as looking back on canvas and the labs to analyze the datasets. Then, we will write our report together and detail what we have finished so far, an updated timeline, and any changes to our project. After submitting this, we will then work on our final project submission together. Throughout our final project submission, we will split up all of the necessary tasks such as creating a title, link to archival record, list of contributors, summary, data profile, findings, potential ideas for future work, steps to reproduce, and references. We will work together and split up all of these responsibilities together. 

Datasets:

NBA Database

This dataset includes data on all 30 NBA teams, as well as over 4,800 players and 65,000 games. There are box scores for over 95% of all of these games, as well as play-by-play game data with 13M+ rows of data.

NBA Players

The dataset contains over two decades of data on each player who has been a part of an NBA roster. It includes demographic variables such as age, height, weight, place of birth, and other details such as team played for, draft year, and round. Additionally, it also contains basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, and assists. 

Timeline: 

We will plan our timeline around our 3 major deadlines. Our initial project plan is due April 2nd, our status / interim report is due April 15th, and our final project submission is due May 1st. For the initial project plan, we will work together to complete all of the initial project plan steps. We will take the week before to write out our overview, write research questions, define our team roles and responsibilities, find our datasets, and draw out our timeline. Our next project deadline is our status / interim report which is due April 15th. Our goal is to have about half of the project done by this deadline, with flushed out ideas for all of our processes, visualizations, and artifacts. We will likely look to have our title, link to archival record and contributors done. We also want to have half of our summary, data profile, findings, future work, steps to reproduce, and references done. Examples of artifacts that we want to have done for our dataset are data integration, data visualization, and automated workflow. After this, our final project deadline is due May 1st. At this deadline, we want to have the rest of our project done and the remaining parts of the steps that were halfway completed for the April 15th status / interim report. Remaining artifacts that we look to have completed include a reproducible package, citations, and metadata. For both the status / interim report due April 15th and the final project submission due May 1st, we will both work together on all of these tasks and items on the to-do list.
