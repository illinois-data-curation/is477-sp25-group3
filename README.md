Project Title & Overview - 
Our project aimed to answer the research question "What is the correlation between offensive rebounds and probability of winning?"
It used an "NBA Database" which included data on all 30 NBA teams, as well as over 4,800 players and 65,000 games. There are box scores for over 95% of all of these games, as well as play-by-play game data with 13M+ rows of data. It also used an "NBA Players" which contained over two decades of data on each player who has been a part of an NBA roster. It includes demographic variables such as age, height, weight, place of birth, and other details such as team played for, draft year, and round. Additionally, it also contains basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, and assists.
